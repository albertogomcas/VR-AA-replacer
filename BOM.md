## Sourcing Notes

### 3D Printing Services
If you don't have access to a 3D printer:
- Local makerspaces or libraries
- Online services (Shapeways, Craftcloud, etc.)
- Local 3D printing services

### Electronic Components
- **Local**: RadioShack (if available), hardware stores
- **Online**: Amazon, Digikey, Mouser, SparkFun
- **Specialty**: Adafruit for maker-friendly components

### Battery Recommendations
- **Alkaline**: Longest shelf life, good for occasional use
- **NiMH Rechargeable**: Better for frequent use, environmentally friendly
- **Lithium**: Longest lasting but more expensive

## Weight Comparison

| Configuration | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| 2x AA Alkaline Batteries | ~46g |
| 2x AA NiMH Batteries | ~54g |
| 2x Printed Replacers + Wires | ~8-12g |
| External Battery Pack (2x AA) | ~46-54g |

**Weight Savings in Controller**: ~34-42g per controller

This represents approximately 20-25% weight reduction in typical VR controllers, with the weight shifted to a more convenient location on the user's body or VR setup.
