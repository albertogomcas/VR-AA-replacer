# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Controller Won't Turn On

#### Symptoms
- Controller completely unresponsive
- No LED indicators
- VR system doesn't detect controller

#### Possible Causes & Solutions

**❌ Wrong Polarity**
- **Solution**: Check wire connections with multimeter
- **Prevention**: Always use red for positive, black for negative
- **Test**: Measure voltage at replacer terminals (should be ~3V)

**❌ No Voltage at Replacer**
- **Solution**: Check external battery charge level
- **Test**: Measure voltage at external battery pack
- **Fix**: Replace or recharge batteries

**❌ Broken Wire Connection**
- **Solution**: Test continuity through each wire
- **Test**: Ohm meter should read <1 ohm through wire
- **Fix**: Re-solder or replace damaged wire

**❌ Poor Contact with Controller**
- **Solution**: Check replacer fit in battery compartment
- **Test**: Gentle pressure should not change controller response
- **Fix**: Adjust replacer dimensions or add contact enhancement

### Intermittent Operation

#### Symptoms
- Controller works sometimes, not others
- Function cuts out during use
- Tracking drops randomly

#### Possible Causes & Solutions

**❌ Loose Wire Connections**
- **Solution**: Check all solder joints and connections
- **Prevention**: Use proper strain relief
- **Fix**: Re-solder with better mechanical connection

**❌ Poor Fit in Battery Compartment**
- **Solution**: Check replacer dimensions
- **Test**: Should fit snugly without excessive force
- **Fix**: Sand replacer or adjust 3D model

**❌ Wire Fatigue**
- **Solution**: Check wire condition, especially at stress points
- **Prevention**: Use flexible wire with adequate service loops
- **Fix**: Replace damaged wire sections

**❌ Oxidized Contacts**
- **Solution**: Clean contacts with electrical contact cleaner
- **Prevention**: Use quality materials and protect from moisture
- **Fix**: Polish contacts or add conductive enhancement

### Poor Battery Life

#### Symptoms
- External batteries drain faster than expected
- Shorter gaming sessions than with original batteries
- Frequent battery replacement needed

#### Possible Causes & Solutions

**❌ High Resistance Connections**
- **Solution**: Check all connections for proper conductivity
- **Test**: Measure voltage drop under load
- **Fix**: Improve solder joints, use thicker wire

**❌ Current Leakage**
- **Solution**: Check for unintended current paths
- **Test**: Measure current with controller off (should be <1mA)
- **Fix**: Insulate connections, check for shorts

**❌ Wrong Battery Type**
- **Solution**: Verify external battery specifications
- **Comparison**: Alkaline vs NiMH vs Lithium capacities differ
- **Fix**: Use appropriate battery type for application

**❌ Controller Malfunction**
- **Solution**: Test controller with original batteries
- **Diagnosis**: Compare current draw with/without modification
- **Fix**: May indicate controller damage from incorrect installation

### Mechanical Issues

#### Symptoms
- Replacer doesn't fit properly
- Parts break during installation
- Wire holes too small/large

#### Possible Causes & Solutions

**❌ Print Quality Issues**
- **Solution**: Check 3D printer calibration
- **Settings**: Verify layer height, infill, and extrusion
- **Fix**: Reprint with improved settings

**❌ Wrong Dimensions**
- **Solution**: Measure actual battery compartment
- **Variation**: Controllers may have slight dimensional differences
- **Fix**: Modify SCAD file for specific controller

**❌ Material Problems**
- **Solution**: Check filament quality and type
- **Recommendation**: PLA for ease, PETG for durability
- **Fix**: Try different material or print settings

### Wiring Problems

#### Symptoms
- Difficult to route wires
- Wires break at stress points
- Connections come loose

#### Possible Causes & Solutions

**❌ Wire Too Stiff**
- **Solution**: Use stranded wire instead of solid
- **Recommendation**: 22 AWG stranded copper
- **Fix**: Replace with more flexible wire

**❌ Inadequate Strain Relief**
- **Solution**: Add service loops and proper routing
- **Method**: Small loop inside replacer, larger loop outside
- **Fix**: Rework wire routing with better strain management

**❌ Wrong Wire Gauge**
- **Solution**: Use appropriate wire size for current and length
- **Calculation**: Voltage drop should be minimal (<0.1V)
- **Fix**: Use thicker wire for longer runs

## Diagnostic Tools and Techniques

### Essential Tools
- **Multimeter**: For voltage, current, and continuity testing
- **Test Leads**: For temporary connections during testing
- **Magnifying Glass**: For inspecting small connections
- **Flashlight/Headlamp**: For working in tight spaces

### Testing Procedures

#### Pre-Installation Testing
1. **Continuity Test**: Check each wire end-to-end
2. **Voltage Test**: Measure at external battery and replacer terminals
3. **Polarity Test**: Verify positive and negative connections
4. **Load Test**: Connect known resistive load and check voltage stability

#### Post-Installation Testing
1. **Function Test**: All controller buttons and features
2. **Tracking Test**: Verify proper VR system tracking
3. **Runtime Test**: Compare to original battery life
4. **Thermal Test**: Check for excessive heating during use

#### Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Weekly Voltage Check**: Measure at replacer terminals
2. **Visual Inspection**: Check wire condition and connections
3. **Performance Check**: Monitor for degraded controller response
4. **Battery Life Tracking**: Record and compare usage times

### Advanced Diagnostics

#### Current Measurement
```
Connect multimeter in series with positive wire:
External Battery (+) -> Multimeter (A) -> Controller

Normal readings:
- Standby: <10mA
- Active use: 50-200mA
- Peak (haptics): 300-500mA
```

#### Voltage Drop Testing
```
Measure voltage at multiple points:
1. External battery terminals
2. At replacer input wires
3. At replacer contact terminals
4. At controller battery contacts

Voltage drop should be <0.2V total
```

#### Impedance Testing
```
With controller off, measure resistance:
- Through each wire: <1 ohm
- Contact to contact: <5 ohms
- External battery to controller: <10 ohms
```

## Prevention Strategies

### Quality Components
- Use quality wire with proper insulation
- Choose appropriate 3D printing materials
- Use proper gauge solder and flux
- Select reliable external battery packs

### Proper Installation
- Follow assembly instructions carefully
- Take time to ensure proper fit and connections
- Test thoroughly before final assembly
