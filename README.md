# VR-AA-replacer
Lighten your VR controller by moving the AA batteries elsewhere

## Overview

This project provides a 3D-printable replacement part that allows you to remove heavy AA batteries from VR controllers and relocate them to a more convenient position. The main objectives are to:

- **Minimize total weight** by replacing AA batteries with lighter AAA batteries
- **Improve center of mass balance** by relocating batteries away from the controller head
- **Enhance comfort** during extended VR sessions by reducing controller weight and improving weight distribution

## The Replacement Part

![AA Replacer Part](AA%20replacer.png)

The replacement part is designed to fit in place of AA batteries in VR controllers. It features:

- Lightweight 3D-printable design
- Two countersunk M3 screw holes for electrical contacts
- Compact form factor that matches AA battery dimensions

## Wiring Instructions

The replacement part uses **two countersunk M3 screws** as electrical contacts to provide power to your VR controller:

1. **Install M3 screws**: Insert countersunk M3 screws into the designated holes on the replacement part
2. **Connect wires**: The M3 screws serve as clamping points for wires that connect to your external battery pack
3. **Wire routing**: Run wires from the screws to your relocated battery pack (AAA batteries in a remote location)
4. **Secure connections**: The screws can be tightened to clamp the wires directly, ensuring reliable electrical contact

### Wiring Setup
- **Positive contact**: Connect the positive wire from your battery pack to the M3 screw that sticks more out
- **Negative contact**: Connect the negative wire from your battery pack to the other M3 screw
- **Wire gauge**: Use appropriate wire gauge for the current requirements of your VR controller
- **Strain relief**: Ensure wires have adequate strain relief to prevent disconnection during use

## Example: VR Table Tennis Paddle

The image above demonstrates a practical application where:

- **Original setup**: Heavy AA batteries located in the paddle head
- **Improved setup**: Lighter AAA batteries relocated to the handle
- **Benefits achieved**:
  - **Reduced total weight**: AAA batteries are lighter than AA batteries
  - **Better balance**: Moving batteries to the handle shifts the center of mass closer to your grip
  - **Improved gameplay**: Better weight distribution enhances control and reduces fatigue

This example shows how the AA-replacer part enables you to transform the weight distribution of VR accessories, making them more comfortable and natural to use.

## Usage Tips

- You can print it in any material, one shell should be enough if you chase minimum weight
- Ensure proper electrical insulation around the M3 screws to prevent short circuits
- Test the electrical connections before final assembly
- Consider using a battery pack with an on/off switch for convenience
