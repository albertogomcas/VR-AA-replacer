# VR AA Battery Replacer

**Lighten your VR controller by moving the AA batteries elsewhere**

This project provides 3D printable replacement parts for AA batteries in VR controllers. The replacements allow you to relocate the actual batteries to a more convenient location (belt pack, backpack, etc.), significantly reducing controller weight and improving balance for extended VR sessions.

## üéØ Problem Solved

VR controllers with AA batteries can become heavy and unbalanced, leading to:
- Hand fatigue during long gaming sessions
- Poor weight distribution affecting immersion
- Controller balance issues with paddle adapters
- Bulky controller profiles

This solution moves the battery weight elsewhere while maintaining full functionality.

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Weight Reduction**: Remove ~40g per controller (20-25% weight savings)
- **Better Balance**: Improve controller weight distribution
- **Extended Sessions**: Reduce hand fatigue for longer gameplay
- **Easy Installation**: Drop-in replacement for standard AA batteries
- **Flexible Power**: Use external battery packs, wall adapters, or power banks
- **Reversible**: Can return to original configuration anytime

## üìÅ Project Files

- **`aa_battery_replacer.scad`** - OpenSCAD 3D model source file
- **`ASSEMBLY.md`** - Detailed assembly and installation instructions
- **`BOM.md`** - Complete bill of materials and cost breakdown
- **`wiring_diagram.md`** - Electrical connection diagrams and specifications

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Print the Parts**: Use the provided SCAD file to print replacement shells
2. **Gather Materials**: See [BOM.md](BOM.md) for required components
3. **Wire the Replacements**: Follow [wiring_diagram.md](wiring_diagram.md) for connections
4. **Assemble**: Complete instructions in [ASSEMBLY.md](ASSEMBLY.md)
5. **Install and Test**: Drop into your VR controller and enjoy lighter gaming!

## üìè Specifications

- **Compatible with**: Standard AA battery compartments (14.5mm diameter)
- **Print Material**: PLA, PETG, or ABS
- **Wire Requirements**: 18-22 AWG, ~1 meter per controller
- **External Power**: 2x AA batteries (3V) or equivalent DC source
- **Weight**: ~8-12g per replacer (vs ~23g per AA battery)

## üîß Customization

The OpenSCAD file allows easy customization for:
- Different battery sizes (AAA, C, D, etc.)
- Custom wire hole positions
- Modified contact dimensions
- Specific VR controller requirements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Disclaimers

- **Polarity Matters**: Incorrect wiring can damage your controller
- **Warranty**: This modification may void your controller warranty
- **Testing**: Always test connections before installation
- **Quality**: Use quality components for reliable operation

See [ASSEMBLY.md](ASSEMBLY.md) for complete safety guidelines.
